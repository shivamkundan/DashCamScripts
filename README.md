# Dash Cam Scripts

## About
Scripts to extract data from my dash cam's recordings.

Latitude, longitude, speed, and altitude are extracted from GPS data stored in standard [NMEA format](https://www.gpsworld.com/what-exactly-is-gps-nmea-data/).

speed_graph.py is used to automatically generate a line plot for speed vs time using matplotlib and numpy.
